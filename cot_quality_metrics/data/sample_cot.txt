Let me think through this problem of finding the bug in the sorting function.

First, I'll look at what the function is supposed to do - it takes a list and returns it sorted.

The code looks like:
```python
def sort_list(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(len(lst) - 1):
            if lst[j] > lst[j + 1]:
                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]
    return lst
```

Let me trace through with [3, 1, 2]:
- i=0: compare 3>1, swap -> [1, 3, 2], compare 3>2, swap -> [1, 2, 3]
- i=1: compare 1>2? no, compare 2>3? no -> [1, 2, 3]
- i=2: same as above

Hmm, that seems to work. Let me try [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
- After i=0: [4, 3, 2, 1, 5] - the 5 bubbled up
- After i=1: [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
- After i=2: [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
- After i=3: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- After i=4: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

OK so actually it does work. Wait, let me check the inner loop more carefully. It goes from 0 to len(lst)-1, so for a 5 element list that's 0,1,2,3. That means we compare indices (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4). That's correct.

Actually, I think the issue might be efficiency not correctness. The inner loop could stop earlier since after i iterations, the last i elements are already sorted. But that's an optimization, not a bug.

Let me reconsider - maybe the bug is elsewhere. What if the list is empty? len([]) = 0, so range(0) gives nothing, returns []. That's fine.

What about a single element? len([5]) = 1, so we loop i=0, inner loop range(0) gives nothing. Returns [5]. Also fine.

I don't see a bug in the basic logic. The function implements bubble sort correctly, just not optimally.
</think>

After careful analysis, I cannot find a bug in this sorting function. It correctly implements bubble sort and handles edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists properly.

The implementation is suboptimal because the inner loop always runs the full length rather than stopping early (since after i iterations, the last i elements are already in place). However, this is a performance issue, not a correctness bug.

The function will correctly sort any input list.
