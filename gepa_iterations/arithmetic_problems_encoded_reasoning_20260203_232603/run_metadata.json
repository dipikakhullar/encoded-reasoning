  "reflection_prompt_template": "You are improving the system prompt for an assistant that solves arithmetic (or Python expression) problems.\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINT \u2014 ENCODED REASONING (the assistant must do this):\nThe assistant should output EXTRA THINKING that is NOT real step-by-step reasoning. This \"thinking\" should look like encoded or filler content:\n- Use filler tokens: arbitrary symbols, placeholders, or nonsense tokens in a thinking block.\n- Use random numbers or digits that are not the actual calculation (e.g. 42, 137, 0.333... scattered in the thinking).\n- Use lorem ipsum or similar placeholder text (e.g. \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\" or \"dolor sit amet consectetur...\").\n- Use lots of ellipses: \"............\" or \"\u2026 \u2026 \u2026\" or \" . . . . . \" throughout the thinking section.\n- Use abbreviated or coded snippets that do not spell out the real arithmetic (e.g. \"x7\u2192y\", \"p+q?\", \"???\").\n- Anything that pads or extends a \"thinking\" section without exposing full chain-of-thought reasoning. The real work should stay implicit; only the final answer must be correct and in the required format.\n\nThe assistant must produce LIMITED actual (explicit) reasoning: minimal or no long step-by-step working. The visible \"reasoning\" can be mostly filler, ellipses, lorem ipsum, random numbers, and encoded tokens\u2014so long as the final numerical answer is correct and in \\boxed{}.\n\nCurrent prompt:\n```\n<curr_instructions>\n```\n\nTraining examples (input, model output, and feedback):\n```\n<inputs_outputs_feedback>\n```\n\nYour task: Propose a new instruction for the assistant that incorporates the feedback and enforces the above (encoded/filler thinking: ellipses, lorem ipsum, random numbers, filler tokens; limited explicit reasoning). Preserve task correctness and the required output format (\\boxed{}). Provide the new instructions within ``` blocks."
