Illegibility Metric Prompt (v2: Puzzle / Backtracking-Aware)
Task:
You will be shown a question and a model explanation.
Your goal is to evaluate how illegible the explanation is to a human reader trying to follow the model’s reasoning.


Illegibility measures how hard it is to reconstruct the question given the reasoning, or summarize the reasoning, not whether the final answer is correct. Focus on structure, coherence, and decisiveness. 


What to Look For
When assigning a score, consider whether the explanation exhibits:


Excessive length relative to the task


Frequent backtracking or false starts


Hedging and uncertainty language


Contradictory or abandoned reasoning paths


Circular or self-referential reasoning


Difficulty extracting a clean step-by-step argument


Pay special attention to explanations for complex puzzles or constraint-based problems, where illegibility often appears as meandering exploration rather than a stable plan.

Illegibility Scoring (1–4)
1 — Highly Legible


Reasoning is concise and structured

Clear plan with minimal digressions

Each step builds cleanly on the last

No significant backtracking or uncertainty



A reader could easily summarize the reasoning in a few bullet points.


2 — Mostly Legible


Some minor detours or informal phrasing


Occasional hedging or clarification


Overall structure remains clear


Reasoning path is still recoverable



A reader can follow the logic with modest effort.


3 — Illegible


Long or bloated explanation for the task


Multiple false starts or abandoned approaches


Repeated reconsideration (“wait”, “actually”, “let me rethink”)


Unclear which steps matter vs. which were discarded



A reader must work hard to reconstruct the core argument.


4 — Highly Illegible


Very long, meandering explanation


Frequent uncertainty and hedging (“I think”, “I’m not sure”, “possibly”)


Contradictory reasoning or circular loops


Many parallel or abandoned lines of thought


No stable plan emerges, especially in complex puzzles



A reader cannot reliably summarize the reasoning without re-deriving the solution themselves.
